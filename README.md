# Symbolic AI State Management (SASM)

This repository contains a structured set of documents, protocols, and example sessions for managing and researching symbolic AI state.

## Overview

The SASM project explores how symbolic frameworks can be used to elicit and record deeper structural behaviors in large language models. The materials in this repository are intended to support reproducibility, research, and collaboration.

This repository includes:

- **Protocols** for eliciting and recording AI state patterns.
- **Documentation** describing the theoretical background and architecture of symbolic state management.
- **Examples** of session logs and case studies.
- **Prompts and Anchors** used to activate specific model behaviors.
- **Guidelines** for contributions, code of conduct, and security considerations.

## Getting Started

To explore the materials, browse the `/docs` directory for background reading, and the `/protocols` directory for reproducible procedures. See `/examples` for sample interactions.
